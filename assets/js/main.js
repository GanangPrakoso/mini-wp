      <p class="mt-4" style="font-family: 'Gelasio', serif;"><i>Honestly
            My eyes have never been so useless
            Unconsciously
            I dive into her warmth, her kindness
            Sever me from the rope that's keeping up, tying me down
            And here goes the free fall...
            Suffocating
            The thought of her suffocates me
            Duplicates my worries and fears that she'll never be mine
            Oh god help me, help me change her mind
            Just let me sleep
            So i can pick up where i left off
            Rewind it back, we'll hope that it makes sense
            And put the midnight fantasies all in repeat
            Dreams of her takes me higher
            Makes me decide to fall back asleep
            Cause she's too far in world number one
            She's my red rose in the other one
            Dreams of her takes me higher
            Beneath it all, she's all i could see
            Cause she's too far in world number one
            She's my red rose in the other one
            Take it from me
            I can't imagine you so beautiful
            As clearly
            Obviously
            I petrify when you walk near me
            You said that two wrongs make a right
            But has our distance minimized?
            One sec, i just blacked out
            So here goes the free fall...
            [Back to Chorus 1 &
            Now breathe in the smoke
            We'll find our way home
            This hasn't happened yet
            But it will, but it will.
            We're silver and gold
            We'll find our way home
            Our hearts set to reset
            Yeah it will, yeah it will
            For the thrill
            This heart keeps screaming louder
            This whole town can hear it, the city knows it
            She'll be my love in world number one
            And keep her running the other one</i>
